The University of Cambridge, UK.

## Content
* **Papers** All conference publications.
* **Slides** Some presentations given through the years.
* **Thesis** A preprint of the PhD thesis, defended in 2014. For final version see the 2016 [Springer book](https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783319279619).

### Technical results
* Proof of sparsity of control action for redundantly actuated systems
* Construction of a Terminal cost (Lyapunov function) and terminal set (Invrariant set) using set-theoretic control
* Terminal conditions for both regulation and tracking of LTI and PWA systems
* Proof of stability and intrinsic robustness using lambda-contractive sets

### Examples
* High fidelity simulation of ship roll stabilisation (achieves state of the art roll reduction with minimum use of rudder)
* Aircraft control with prioritised actuators
* Network congestion control with backup routes
* For spacecraft control with minimum thruster constraint see the [journal paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207179.2013.789608)
